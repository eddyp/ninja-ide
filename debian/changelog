ninja-ide (2.3-2) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * Fix addins/ location, and make runtime-data-patch more robust
  * Also moved img/ under /usr/share/ninja-ide/
  * Directly install ninja-ide.py to /usr/bin, instead of making a symlink
  * Updated debian/copyright
  * Drop repackaging targets from debian/rules
  * 01-use_system_pyflakes.patch dropped: upstream is using a forked
    customized version of pyflakes. Since there are no licensing issues,
    I'm including it in the package, so as to avoid differences with
    upstream behaviour.
