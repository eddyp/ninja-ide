Description: integrated development environment (IDE) for Python
 NINJA-IDE is a cross-platform integrated development environment (IDE).
 It currently features:
  .
  * code editor: NINJA-IDE provides a complete code editor with highlighting
    for several languages, code completion, code assistant for imports,
    navigation, etc.
  .
  * project management: NINJA-IDE allows to manage python projects
    automatically, saving descriptive information about them and letting the
    user perform file-management-related tasks in the IDE itself.
  .
  * high extensibility: you can create plugins for several purposes, and they
    can be completely integrated within the IDE, increasing the available
    features.
